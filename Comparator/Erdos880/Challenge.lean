# Erdős #880 (Burr–Erdős restricted addition) — comparator CHALLENGE (the trusted audit surface)

This file is the **thing a human audits.** It imports *only* Mathlib, defines every notion used
in the headline statements, and states them with `sorry`. `Solution.lean` (which imports the real
development) must prove *these exact statements*, and `comparator` machine-checks that it did:
every declaration appearing in a statement here must be **identical** in the solution environment,
the proofs must be accepted by the Lean kernel, and they may use no axioms beyond
`propext`, `Quot.sound`, `Classical.choice`.

So the trust chain is: *read this file, and only this file* — then comparator certifies the rest.

⚠️ Deliberately **no definition holes** (`definition_names`). Comparator only checks a hole's name,
type and universe, which is a gameable surface (its own README: a hole "can be gamed without
additional oversight"). Every definition below carries its real body, so it is covered by the
strict statement-identity check instead.

## The problem

Let `A ⊆ ℕ` be an additive basis of order `k` (every large integer is a sum of at most `k` elements
of `A`), and let `B` be the set of integers that are a sum of `k` or fewer **pairwise distinct**
elements of `A`. Burr and Erdős asked: **are the gaps `b_{n+1} − b_n` of `B` bounded?**

Hegyvári, Hennecart and Plagne resolved it:

* **`k = 2`: YES** — the gaps are eventually `≤ 2` (`erdos_880_order_two`), equivalently
  `Δ(2 × A) ≤ 2` (`erdos_880_order_two_delta`). This holds for *every* basis of order `2`.
* **`k ≥ 3`: NO** — there **exists** a basis of order `k` whose restricted-sum set has arbitrarily
  long gaps (`erdos_880`), equivalently `Δ = +∞` (`erdos_880_delta`). The negative answer is the
  headline, and it is an **existence** claim: the witness basis is exhibited (`constA`, inlined
  below in full), so the statement is not vacuous.

`Δ` is the paper's asymptotic gap functional `Δ(X) = limsup_{i→∞} (a_{i+1} − a_i) ∈ ℕ ∪ {+∞}`,
rendered here (`Delta`) via the elementary identity `limsup g = inf {d | eventually gₙ ≤ d}`: the
least `d` that *eventually* bounds the consecutive gaps of `X`, or `⊤` if none does.

/-! ### The headlines

Note both `k ≥ 3` headlines are stated **existentially**, which is what HHP07 Theorem 1(ii) actually
claims ("for `k ≥ 3` the answer is no" = a counterexample basis exists). The proof supplies the
explicit Hegyvári–Hennecart–Plagne witness, but naming that construction *here* would drag its
recurrence (`xseq`, `block`, `constA`) into the trusted surface, forcing a reader to audit a
definition the theorem does not depend on. The existential form is both the faithful rendering and
the smaller thing to check. -/

/-- **Erdős Problem #880 (the resolution, `k ≥ 3`).** For every order `h ≥ 3` there **exists** an
additive basis `A` of order `h` whose set of restricted sums (sums of `≤ h` distinct elements) has
arbitrarily long gaps. So the Burr–Erdős gap-boundedness fails for `k ≥ 3`.

This is an existence statement, which is its own non-vacuity witness: a basis of order `h` really is
produced, and its restricted-sum set really does have unbounded gaps. -/

set has gaps eventually bounded by `2`. This is the positive half of the answer. -/

/-- **Erdős #880, faithful `Δ` form (`k ≥ 3`).** For every `h ≥ 3` there exists a basis `A` of order
`h` whose restricted-sum set has asymptotic gap functional `Δ = +∞` — exactly the paper's
`Δ(𝒜 ∪ 2×𝒜 ∪ ⋯ ∪ h×𝒜) = +∞` (HHP07 Theorem 1(ii)). This restates the negative answer in the paper's
own `limsup` language rather than via the `UnboundedGaps` predicate. -/
