# Goodstein — ground-truth anchors (faithfulness gate)

Hand-computed FULL Goodstein trajectories for the seeds `m = 0,1,2,3` (bases
`2,3,4,…`; bump-then-subtract-one; `0` absorbing). Derivation in `README.md`.

These are the anti-vacuity lock on the `goodsteinSeq` definition: a placeholder
or vacuous definition cannot reproduce the nonzero intermediate values. Now that
`goodsteinSeq` is faithfully defined, each is discharged by `native_decide` (the
definition computes the genuine trajectories below). They MUST stay in `src/` so
they count toward the `--allow-stop` sorry-gate.

`native_decide` here is fine — these are standalone `example`s, never on
`goodstein_terminates`'s axiom path. Re-check `#print axioms goodstein_terminates`
after, not these.

Trajectories (length = steps to reach 0):
  m=0:  0
  m=1:  1, 0
  m=2:  2, 2, 1, 0
  m=3:  3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0
