# Kirby–Paris hydra — proof engine (well-founded descent)

This file is the machinery behind `hydra_terminates`. It is NOT part of the audit
surface (that is `Basic`/`Statement`); it just has to be correct, which the kernel
checks.

## Strategy

Every chop strictly lowers the Kirby–Paris ordinal of the hydra (its value `< ε₀`,
the natural sum `♯ ωᵒ⁽ᶜ⁾` over children). Rather than build that ordinal by hand
(mathlib's `Ordinal.nadd` natural sum was removed), we realize the *same* well-order
as a **recursive multiset (path) order** `HLt` on trees and reuse mathlib's hydra
engine `Relation.CutExpand`:

* `HLt (node s') (node s)` holds when `s'` is obtained from `s` by removing one child
  `a` and grafting back finitely many children all `HLt`-below `a` — i.e. one
  `CutExpand HLt` step on the child multisets. (We pin the removed `a ∈ s` into the
  definition; this makes irreflexivity a plain structural induction and breaks the
  bootstrap with well-foundedness.)
* `HLt` is **well-founded**: `node` transports `Relation.WellFounded.cutExpand`'s
  accessibility through the tree (`acc_node`), and a structural induction supplies the
  children's accessibility.
* Every legal `Step` strictly descends `HLt` (`step_hlt`); the depth-one and grandparent
  regrowth cases are both instances of the atomic "remove a head" decrease
  (`hlt_eraseHead`), lifted by the single-replacement congruence built into `HLt`.

Then a battle is `HLt`-decreasing while alive, and `WellFounded.has_min` forbids an
infinite one — mirroring Goodstein's `Engine.lean`.

/-- **Recursive multiset (path) order on hydras.** `HLt x y` means `x` is one
Kirby–Paris descent below `y`: writing `x = node s'`, `y = node s`, the child multiset
`s'` is `s` with one child `a` (pinned present, `a ∈ s`) removed and an arbitrary finite
multiset `t` of strictly-`HLt`-smaller children grafted back. This is exactly a
`Relation.CutExpand HLt` step on the children, and its rank is the Kirby–Paris ordinal
`< ε₀`. -/
