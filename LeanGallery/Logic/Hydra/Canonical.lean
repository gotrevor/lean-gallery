# The canonical hydra battle

A single, computable Hercules strategy for the Kirby–Paris game, for use as the object of the
PA-independence result (`gotrevor/goodstein-independence`, `ROADMAP-EPSILON0.md` stage 2).

* `ord` (`Ordinal.lean`) — the Kirby–Paris ordinal of a hydra as a Cantor-normal-form `ONote`
  (natural sum `♯ ω^{ord c}` over the children).
* `canonStep n` — the move at turn `n`: descend along the **first child of minimal ordinal** until
  a head is reached, and chop it.  Order-independent up to ties (tied children have equal
  ordinals), so the battle follows the fundamental sequence of `ord` rather than the incidental
  list order.  Output shapes are exactly those of `Step.root` / `Chop.grand` / `Chop.deep`.
* `battle h k` — the hydra after `k` canonical moves from `h`, move `j` at turn `j` (so turn `j`
  leaves `j + 1` copies of the cut node, the survivor included, per `Chop.grand`).
* `ofCode` / `toCode` — a bijection `ℕ ≃ Hydra` (Cantor pairing), the input encoding.

Main results: `canonStep_legal` (every nonterminal canonical move is a legal `Step`),
`battle_terminates` (from `hydra_terminates`), `ofCode_toCode` / `ofCode_surjective`.
