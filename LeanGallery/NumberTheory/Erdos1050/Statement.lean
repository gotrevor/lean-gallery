# Erdős Problem #1050 — is `∑_{n ≥ 1} 1/(2ⁿ − 3)` irrational?

## The statement

> The real number `∑_{n ≥ 1} 1/(2ⁿ − 3)` is irrational.

exactly as posed on erdosproblems.com (`Is ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(2ⁿ − 3) irrational?`, answer: yes).

Formalised as `erdos_1050_literal : Irrational Sliteral`, where
`Sliteral := ∑' n : ℕ, 1/(2^(n+1) − 3)`. Lean's `∑' n : ℕ` ranges over `n ≥ 0`, so the source's
`n ≥ 1` sum is encoded by the standard reindex `n ↦ n + 1` (the tsum's `n = 0` summand is the
source's first term, `1/(2¹ − 3)`). That `(n+1)` shift is the *only* thing to reconcile against the
source, and it is transparent.

**This file is the audit surface.** To check that this repository proves the *right thing*, read only
this file: `Sliteral` and `erdos_1050_literal` are the entire trusted statement. Everything else
(`Basic.lean`, `Criterion.lean`, `Approximants.lean`, `Lemma3.lean`, …) is the proof engine.

## Provenance

* **Problem source.** P. Erdős & R. Graham, relayed at <https://www.erdosproblems.com/1050>
  ("Is `∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(2ⁿ − 3)` irrational?", answer yes).
* **Resolving theorem.** P. B. Borwein, *On the irrationality of `∑ 1/(qⁿ + r)`*, J. Number Theory
  **37** (1991) 253–259 (and the cleaner *On the irrationality of certain series*, Math. Proc. Camb.
  Phil. Soc. **112** (1992) 141–146), specialized to `q = 2, r = −3`.

## Faithfulness notes

* **Indexing.** The series runs over `n ≥ 1` (the source's `∑_{n=1}^∞`). In Lean it is the tsum
  `∑' n : ℕ, 1/(2^(n+1) − 3)`, whose `n = 0` summand `1/(2¹ − 3) = −1` is the source's first term.
* **Well-definedness.** `2ⁿ − 3` is never `0` (`2ⁿ = 3` has no solution), so every term `1/(2ⁿ − 3)`
  is a genuine real.
* **Reduction (proved, not asserted).** The proof engine works with the positive-denominator tail
  `S = ∑_{n ≥ 0} 1/(2^(n+2) − 3)` (see `Basic.lean`); the headline reduces the literal series to it by
  `(∑_{n ≥ 1} 1/(2ⁿ − 3)) = -1 + S` — the single low term `1/(2¹−3) = -1` is rational, and
  irrationality is invariant under adding a rational, so `erdos_1050_literal ↔ erdos_1050`. This
  equivalence is `Sliteral_eq`, proved below.
* **Axiom footprint.** `#print axioms erdos_1050_literal` should end at
  `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` (kernel-pure; no `native_decide`, no custom axioms).

/-! ### Non-vacuity anchors

Executable evidence that the series computes as intended, so the irrationality claim is not an
artifact of a mis-stated series. (The claim is already self-certifying against the worst failure
mode: mathlib sets a non-summable `tsum` to `0`, and `Irrational 0` is false — so
`erdos_1050_literal` is provable only because the series genuinely converges to a non-rational real,
never vacuously.) -/

/-- Well-definedness: no term is a junk `1/0`, since the denominator `2ⁿ − 3` is never zero. -/
