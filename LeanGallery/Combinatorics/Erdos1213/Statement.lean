# Erdős #1213 — the designated statement (AUDIT SURFACE)

**If you are checking that this repository proves the right thing, read THIS file.**

Everything else (`Counting.lean`, `Analytic.lean`, `Main.lean`) is the proof engine. The two theorems
below are the load-bearing statements: each is *definitionally* the corresponding engine theorem, so it
cannot drift, but here the bound `L` is written out verbatim and the English is spelled out.

To confirm faithfulness you only need to read, in addition to the signatures below:
* `csum` and `AllCSumsDistinct` in `Basic.lean` (≈ 4 lines) — the block-sum and distinctness notions;
* `validLastTerms` and `hegyvariF` in `Main.lean` (≈ 6 lines) — the definition of the paper's `f(a,K)`.

Source: N. Hegyvári, *On consecutive sums in sequences*, Acta Math. Hungar. **48** (1986) 193–200,
Theorem 3 (DOI 10.1007/BF01949064). Problem page: <https://www.erdosproblems.com/1213>.

Both theorems are axiom-clean: `#print axioms` ends at `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

/-- **Erdős Problem #1213 — Hegyvári's Theorem 3 (last-term form).**

Let `a 1 < a 2 < … < a s` be strictly increasing positive integers whose consecutive gaps are at most
`K` (`a (i+1) ≤ a i + K`). If **all** consecutive-block sums `csum a u v = a u + … + a v` are distinct
(`AllCSumsDistinct`), then the last term is bounded:
```
a s  <  (a 1 + K/2)·e^(K+1) + K·e^(2K+2).
```
In particular no such "all block-sums distinct" sequence can be arbitrarily long.

Sanity anchors from the paper (largest achievable last term `f(a,K)`): `f(1,1)=2`, `f(2,1)=4`,
`f(1,2)=7`, `f(2,2)=8` (the bound is correct but loose — e.g. it only asserts `f(1,1) < 65.7`).

This is `hegyvari_thm3` with the bound written out; the proof just unfolds `hegyvariBound`. -/

/-- **Erdős Problem #1213 — finiteness of `f(a,K)`.**

`hegyvariF init K` is the paper's `f(a,K)`: the supremum (over all valid sequences with first term
`init` and gaps `≤ K` whose block-sums are all distinct) of the last term. This theorem says that
supremum is finite, bounded by the same constant `L`:
```
f(init, K)  ≤  (init + K/2)·e^(K+1) + K·e^(2K+2).
```
This is the form closest to how the problem is posed ("is `f(a,K)` finite?"). It is `hegyvariF_le_bound`
with the bound written out. -/
